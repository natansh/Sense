1. For build script integration, check out

a) A really good video tutorial - by Jay George.
http://www.jaygeorge.co.uk/2-html5-build-script-wordpress-2/

b) This wordpress related documentation on the Boilerplate website.
http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/Build-script/#wordpress-integration


2. Build script dependencies

Note that to be able to run the build script, there might be a need 
for installing certain resources, and these resources are platform
dependent.

They are mentioned here -
http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/Build-script/#dependencies

3. Procedure

a) Take the build folder from the HTML5 Boilerplate directory,
and add it to the Wordpress theme root folder.

b) Modify the config/project.properties to use the correct folder
for CSS and images.
    i) Make the css folder point to root. Wordpress assumes
    style.css resides in root. Note that Jay George suggests that
    we modify the default.properties folder for this, but I believe
    it can be done just by the following line.

        dir.css = .     

    ii) Make the images folder point to 'images'. The default is
    imgs, but Wordpress makes an assumption for the folder where 
    images are stored.

        dir.images = images

c) Checkpoint: The build script should currently work if you don't have
any php files for now. If you do, then there is more work to be done.
